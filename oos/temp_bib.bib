  abstract = {Despite the pressing need for accurate forecasts of ecological and evolutionary responses to environmental change, commonly used modeling approaches exhibit mixed performance because they omit many important aspects of how organisms respond to spatially and temporally variable environments. Integrating models based on organismal phenotypes at the physiological, performance, and fitness levels can improve model performance. We summarize current limitations of environmental data and models and discuss potential remedies. The paper reviews emerging techniques for sensing environments at fine spatial and temporal scales, accounting for environmental extremes, and capturing how organisms experience the environment. Intertidal mussel data illustrate biologically important aspects of environmental variability. We then discuss key challenges in translating environmental conditions into organismal performance including accounting for the varied timescales of physiological processes, for responses to environmental fluctuations including the onset of stress and other thresholds, and for how environmental sensitivities vary across lifecycles. We call for the creation of phenotypic databases to parameterize forecasting models and advocate for improved sharing of model code and data for model testing. We conclude with challenges in organismal biology that must be solved to improve forecasts over the next decade.},

  abstract = {A main concern in marine ecology is understanding the mechanisms driving the responses of biological systems to environmental fluctuations. A major issue is that each biological system (e.g. organism, ecosystem) experiences fluctuations according to its own intrinsic characteristics. For instance, how an organism experiences a thermal fluctuation, i.e. as a long marine heatwave or as a mild pulse, depends on its thermal tolerance and developmental time, which can vary as the fluctuation is experienced. Here, a geometric approach is explored, considering the biological perspective. Environmental fluctuations are represented as points in a `space of fluctuations'. The biological perspective is then defined as a coordinate frame within that space. Coordinates are given by components (e.g. amplitude and time scale) characterising each environmental fluctuation, which are then transformed into biological scales, using biological traits (tolerance and biological time). Using simulations of organisms growing under thermal fluctuations with different characteristics, the present study shows how this approach (1) enables the integration of physiology and phenology to better interpret biological responses to fluctuating environments; (2) improves our understanding of the role of adaptive plasticity as a rescue effect; and (3) facilitates our understanding of the effects of thermal fluctuations on additional organismal traits (e.g. body mass). Wider applications in the context of species persistence, coexistence, biodiversity and ecosystem function in scenarios of extreme fluctuations are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Understanding the resilience of temperate reefs to climate change requires exploring the recovery capacity of their habitat-forming species from recurrent marine heatwaves (MHWs). Here, we show that, in a Mediterranean highly enforced marine protected area established more than 40 years ago, habitat-forming octocoral populations that were first affected by a severe MHW in 2003 have not recovered after 15 years. Contrarily, they have followed collapse trajectories that have brought them to the brink of local ecological extinction. Since 2003, impacted populations of the red gorgonian Paramuricea clavata (Risso, 1826) and the red coral Corallium rubrum (Linnaeus, 1758) have followed different trends in terms of size structure, but a similar progressive reduction in density and biomass. Concurrently, recurrent MHWs were observed in the area during the 2003--2018 study period, which may have hindered populations recovery. The studied octocorals play a unique habitat-forming role in the coralligenous assemblages (i.e. reefs endemic to the Mediterranean Sea home to approximately 10\% of its species). Therefore, our results underpin the great risk that recurrent MHWs pose for the long-term integrity and functioning of these emblematic temperate reefs.},

  abstract = {Marine heatwaves (MHWs) have been observed around the world and are expected to increase in intensity and frequency under anthropogenic climate change. A variety of impacts have been associated with these anomalous events, including shifts in species ranges, local extinctions and economic impacts on seafood industries through declines in important fishery species and impacts on aquaculture. Extreme temperatures are increasingly seen as important influences on biological systems, yet a consistent definition of MHWs does not exist. A clear definition will facilitate retrospective comparisons between MHWs, enabling the synthesis and a mechanistic understanding of the role of MHWs in marine ecosystems. Building on research into atmospheric heatwaves, we propose both a general and specific definition for MHWs, based on a hierarchy of metrics that allow for different data sets to be used in identifying MHWs. We generally define a MHW as a prolonged discrete anomalously warm water event that can be described by its duration, intensity, rate of evolution, and spatial extent. Specifically, we consider an anomalously warm event to be a MHW if it lasts for five or more days, with temperatures warmer than the 90th percentile based on a 30-year historical baseline period. This structure provides flexibility with regard to the description of MHWs and transparency in communicating MHWs to a general audience. The use of these metrics is illustrated for three 21st century MHWs; the northern Mediterranean event in 2003, the Western Australia `Ningaloo Ni{\~n}o' in 2011, and the northwest Atlantic event in 2012. We recommend a specific quantitative definition for MHWs to facilitate global comparisons and to advance our understanding of these phenomena.},

Most studies to date assume that stressors operate in perfect synchrony, but this will rarely be the case in reality. Stressor sequence and overlap will have implications for ecological memory -- the ability of past stressors to influence future responses. Moreover, stressors are usually defined in an anthropocentric context: what we consider a short-term stressor, such as a flood, will span multiple generations of microbes. We argue that to predict responses to multiple stressors from individuals to the whole ecosystem, it is necessary to consider metabolic rates, which determine the timescales at which individuals operate and therefore, ultimately, the ecological memory at different levels of ecological organization.},

Research on extreme events (``event-focused'' in contrast to ``trend-focused'') has increased in recent years and, in 2004, accounted for one-fifth of the experimental climate-change studies published. Numerous examples, ranging from microbiology and soil science to biogeography, demonstrate how extreme weather events can accelerate shifts in species composition and distribution, thereby facilitating changes in ecosystem functioning. However, assessing the importance of extreme events for ecological processes poses a major challenge because of the very nature of such events: their effects are out of proportion to their short duration. We propose that extreme events can be characterized by statistical extremity, timing, and abruptness relative to the life cycles of the organisms affected. To test system response to changing magnitude and frequency of weather events, controlled experiments are useful tools. These experiments provide essential insights for science and for societies that must develop coping strategies for such events. Here, we discuss future research needs for climate-change experiments in ecology. For illustration, we describe an experimental plan showing how to meet the challenge posed by changes in the frequency or magnitude of extreme events.},

Here we show that the rate of biological processes maintaining growth, homeostasis and ageing in the permissive temperature range increases by 7\% per degree Celsius (median activation energy Ea\,=\,0.48\,eV from 1,351 rates across 314 species). By contrast, the processes underlying heat failure rate within the stressful temperature range are extremely temperature sensitive, such that heat failure increases by more than 100\% per degree Celsius across a broad range of taxa (median Ea\,=\,6.13\,eV from 123 rates across 112 species). The extreme thermal sensitivity of heat failure rates implies that the projected increase in the frequency and intensity of heatwaves can exacerbate heat mortality for many ectothermic species with severe and disproportionate consequences. Combining the extreme thermal sensitivities with projected increases in maximum temperatures globally6, we predict that moderate warming scenarios can increase heat failure rates by 774\% (terrestrial) and 180\% (aquatic) by 2100. This finding suggests that we are likely to underestimate the potential impact of even a modest global warming scenario.},

  abstract = {Projected increases in the variability of both temperature and precipitation will result in the greater likelihood and magnitude of extreme weather (e.g., cold snaps, droughts, heat waves) with potential implications for animal populations. Despite the ecological consequences of extreme weather, there are several challenges in identifying extreme events and measuring their influence on key demographic processes in free-living animals. First, there is often a mismatch between the spatial and/or temporal resolution of biological and climate data that could hinder our ability to draw accurate inferences about how species and populations respond to extreme events. Second, there are multiple approaches for identifying an extreme event ranging from statistical definitions (e.g., standardized deviates) to species-specific biological thresholds. Lastly, the impacts of extreme weather on species can vary as a function of differences in exposure and intrinsic sensitivity to climate variability. In the Northern Hemisphere, rapid warming has contributed to a ``wobblier'' jet stream that promotes the higher likelihood of cold Arctic air moving southward and leading to more extreme winter conditions. Due to these conditions, the Upper Midwest experienced two of the coldest winters in the past 35 yr during 2014 and 2015. We combined radiofrequency identification technologies with fine-scale weather data and standard capture--mark--recapture analyses to estimate weekly and overwinter survival rates of a common winter passerine, the Black-capped Chickadee (Poecile atricapillus), in a near continuous fashion. Using both statistical and biological definitions of weather extremes, we found that declining ambient temperatures reduced survival (despite the presence of favorable microclimates), and that biologically defined thresholds of extreme weather were better at explaining variation in survival than statistical ones. Moreover, habitat fragmentation interacted with temperature to modify the exposure of birds to extreme weather with survival consequences, but sensitivity, as measured by body condition, did not appear to play a significant role. These results provide a novel contribution to the understanding of how extreme weather may interact with local- and landscape features to influence the demography of species and populations, and suggest potential opportunities for climate-change adaptation in human-dominated landscapes.},

  abstract = {In the framework of climate change, the increase in ocean heat wave frequency is expected to impact marine life. Large-scale positive temperature anomalies already occurred in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea in 1999, 2003 and 2006. These anomalies were associated with mass mortality events of macrobenthic species in coastal areas (0--40 m in depth). The anomalies were particularly severe in 1999 and 2003 when thousands of kilometres of coasts and about 30 species were affected. The aim of this study was to develop a methodology to assess the current risk of mass mortality associated with temperature increase along NW Mediterranean continental coasts. A 3D regional ocean model was used to obtain the temperature conditions for the period 2001--2010, for which the model outputs were validated by comparing them with in situ observations in affected areas. The model was globally satisfactory, although extremes were underestimated and required correction. Combined with information on the thermo-tolerance of a key species (the red gorgonian P. clavata) as well as its spatial distribution, the modelled temperature conditions were then used to assess the risk of mass mortality associated with thermal stress for the first time. Most of the known areas of observed mass mortality were found using the model, although the degree of risk in certain areas was underestimated. Using climatic IPCC scenarios, the methodology could be applied to explore the impacts of expected climate change in the NW Mediterranean. This is a key issue for the development of sound management and conservation plans to protect Mediterranean marine biodiversity in the face of climate change.},

  abstract = {Accounting for heat burdens As climate warming becomes more and more apparent and influential, there is an increasing desire to predict its long-term impacts on species. Classically, this has been done by extrapolating lethal limits based on those observed in the laboratory. In the real world, however, organisms do not experience a single high temperature that then returns to a comfortable temperature, but rather a series of high temperatures during the hot season. Rezende et al. accounted for these accumulative effects in a dynamic model that accurately predicted empirical patterns in wild fruit fly populations, showing that cumulative effects of warming temperatures can be included in future estimates (see the Perspective by Huey and Kearney). Science, this issue p. 1242; see also p. 1163 Average and extreme temperatures will increase in the near future, but how such shifts will affect mortality in natural populations is still unclear. We used a dynamic model to predict mortality under variable temperatures on the basis of heat tolerance laboratory measurements. Theoretical lethal temperatures for 11 Drosophila species under different warming conditions were virtually indistinguishable from empirical results. For Drosophila in the field, daily mortality predicted from ambient temperature records accumulate over weeks or months, consistent with observed seasonal fluctuations and population collapse in nature. Our model quantifies temperature-induced mortality in nature, which is crucial to study the effects of global warming on natural populations, and analyses highlight that critical temperatures are unreliable predictors of mortality. Accounting for cumulative effects of warming improves mortality predictions in wild fruit flies. Accounting for cumulative effects of warming improves mortality predictions in wild fruit flies.},

  abstract = {Climate change is impacting ecosystems worldwide, and the Mediterranean Sea is no exception. Extreme climatic events, such as marine heat waves (MHWs), are increasing in frequency, extent and intensity during the last decades, which has been associated with an increase in mass mortality events for multiple species. Coralligenous assemblages, where the octocoral Paramuricea clavata lives, are strongly affected by MHWs. The Medes Islands Marine Reserve (NW Mediterranean) was considered a climate refugia for P. clavata, as their populations were showing some resilience to these changing conditions. In this study, we assessed the impacts of the MHWs that occurred between 2016 and 2022 in seven shallow populations of the octocoral P. clavata from a Mediterranean Marine Protected Area. The years that the mortality rates increased significantly were associated with the ones with strong MHWs, 2022 being the one with higher mortalities. In 2022, with 50 MHW days, the proportion of total affected colonies was almost 70\%, with a proportion of the injured surface of almost 40\%, reaching levels never attained in our study site since the monitoring was started. We also found spatial variability between the monitored populations. Whereas few of them showed low levels of mortality, others lost around 75\% of their biomass. The significant impacts documented here raise concerns about the future of shallow P. clavata populations across the Mediterranean, suggesting that the resilience of this species may not be maintained to sustain these populations face the ongoing warming trends.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Detailed research has documented gradual changes to biological communities attributed to increases in global average temperatures. However, localized and abrupt temperature anomalies associated with heatwaves may cause more rapid biological changes. We analyzed temperature data from the South Island of New Zealand and investigated whether the hot summer of 2017/18 affected species of bull kelp, {$<$}italic{$>$}Durvillaea{$<$}/italic{$><$}italic{$>$}antarctica{$<$}/italic{$>$}, {$<$}italic{$>$}D. poha{$<$}/italic{$>$}, and {$<$}italic{$>$}D. willana.{$<$}/italic{$><$}italic{$>$}Durvillaea{$<$}/italic{$>$} spp. are large iconic seaweeds that inhabit the low intertidal zone of exposed coastlines, where they underpin biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Sea surface temperatures (SST) during the summer of 2017/18 included the strongest marine heatwaves recorded in 38 years of existing oceanic satellite data for this region. Air temperatures were also high, and, coupled with small wave heights, resulted in strong desiccation stress during daytime low tides. Before-After analysis of drone images of four reef platforms (42, 42, 44, and 45{$^\circ$}S) was used to evaluate changes to bull kelp over the hot summer. Bull kelp loss varied among species and reefs, with the greatest (100\%) loss of {$<$}italic{$>$}D.{$<$}/italic{$><$}italic{$>$}poha{$<$}/italic{$>$} at Pile Bay in Lyttelton Harbor (44{$^\circ$}S). In Pile Bay, SST exceeded 23{$^\circ$}C and air temperatures exceeded 30{$^\circ$}C, while {$<$}italic{$>$}Durvillaea{$<$}/italic{$>$} was exposed for up to 3 h per day during low tide. Follow-up surveys showed that all bull kelps were eliminated from Pile Bay, and from all reefs within and immediately outside of Lyttelton Harbor. Following the localized extinction of bull kelp in Pile Bay, the invasive kelp {$<$}italic{$>$}Undaria pinnatifida{$<$}/italic{$>$} recruited in high densities (average of 120 m\textsuperscript{-2}). We conclude that bull kelps are likely to experience additional mortalities in the future because heatwaves are predicted to increase in magnitude and durations.

  abstract = {More extreme climatic events (ECEs) are among the most prominent consequences of climate change. Despite a long-standing recognition of the importance of ECEs by paleo-ecologists and macro-evolutionary biologists, ECEs have only recently received a strong interest in the wider ecological and evolutionary community. However, as with many rapidly expanding fields, it lacks structure and cohesiveness, which strongly limits scientific progress. Furthermore, due to the descriptive and anecdotal nature of many ECE studies it is still unclear what the most relevant questions and long-term consequences are of ECEs. To improve synthesis, we first discuss ways to define ECEs that facilitate comparison among studies. We then argue that biologists should adhere to more rigorous attribution and mechanistic methods to assess ECE impacts. Subsequently, we discuss conceptual and methodological links with climatology and disturbance-, tipping point- and paleo-ecology. These research fields have close linkages with ECE research, but differ in the identity and/or the relative severity of environmental factors. By summarizing the contributions to this theme issue we draw parallels between behavioural, ecological and evolutionary ECE studies, and suggest that an overarching challenge is that most empirical and theoretical evidence points towards responses being highly idiosyncratic, and thus predictability being low. Finally, we suggest a roadmap based on the proposition that an increased focus on the mechanisms behind the biological response function will be crucial for increased understanding and predictability of the impacts of ECE. This article is part of the themed issue `Behavioural, ecological and evolutionary responses to extreme climatic events'.},

When thermal stress exceeds organismal capacity to maintain homeostasis, organism survival becomes time-limited and can result in mass mortality events.                                                     Current methods of detecting and categorizing MHWs rely on statistical analysis of historic climatology and do not consider biological effects as a basis of MHW severity. The re-emergence of ectotherm thermal tolerance landscape models provides a physiological framework for assessing the lethal effects of MHWs by accounting for both the magnitude and duration of extreme heat events.                                                     Here, we used a simulation approach to understand the effects of a suite of MHW profiles on organism survival probability across (1) three thermal tolerance adaptive strategies, (2) interannual temperature variation and (3) seasonal timing of MHWs.                                                     We identified survival isoclines across MHW magnitude and duration where acute (short duration-high magnitude) and chronic (long duration-low magnitude) events had equivalent lethal effects on marine organisms. While most research attention has focused on chronic MHW events, we show similar lethal effects can be experienced by more common but neglected acute marine heat spikes. Critically, a statistical definition of MHWs does not accurately categorize biological mortality.                                                     By letting organism responses define the extremeness of a MHW event, we can build a mechanistic understanding of MHW effects from a physiological basis. Organism responses can then be transferred across scales of ecological organization and better predict marine ecosystem shifts to MHWs.},
